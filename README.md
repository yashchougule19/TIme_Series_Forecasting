# Time_Series_Forecasting
For better understanding, I have kept two separate notebooks, 
one for RNN (RNN_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb) and 
the other for MLP (MLP_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb).

Also because I have tried to do a rolling forecast in the MLP regressor, I had to combine the train and test set along with creating their lag features. This I did beforehand in excel and saved under the name of Train_Test_Time_Series.csv. 
The MLP regressor notebook is processed on this dataset which is one of the reason why I have 2 independent notebooks.
My request to you is to use this dataset while running the MLP notebook.

The Element_1.ipynb is the notebook that was to generate predictions for element 1. Inline with prof. Lessmann's email, it is completely untouched and in its raw form. I am not sure if it can straight away run but the only intension is to demonstrate the level of invested efforts.

Thank you very much for your understanding.
